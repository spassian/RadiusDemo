 Design Pattern or Architecture:
The assignment solution uses the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern. MVVM separates the presentation logic from the view, making the code more modular and testable. The model represents the data and business logic, the view displays the user interface, and the view model acts as an intermediary between the model and view, handling data binding and user interactions. This separation of concerns helps to maintain code clarity, reusability, and easier unit testing.


Third-party Frameworks/Libraries:
The assignment solution does not use any third-party frameworks or libraries. It relies solely on the built-in capabilities of SwiftUI and the Swift programming language to implement the required functionality. This approach promotes code simplicity, reduces dependencies, and allows for a more lightweight and native development experience.


By leveraging the MVVM design pattern and avoiding the use of third-party frameworks, the solution aims to provide a clean and straightforward implementation that adheres to Swift and SwiftUI best practices. This approach ensures better maintainability, flexibility, and compatibility with future updates of SwiftUI and Swift.
